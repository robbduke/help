## Payor Report: BCBSM / BCN

{% hint style="success" %}

* **Delegated Credentialing**\
  No delegated credentialing pathway is applicable for this provider type.
* **Telehealth Coverage**\
  Occupational therapy services are covered under some BCBSM/BCN commercial plans. Coverage should be verified per plan before offering telehealth services.

* **Action Required**\
  Submit the group application via Availity, including required legal documents. Prepare provider documentation for linking after group approval.
{% endhint %}

**Fee Schedule Visibility**\
📉 Low — Fee schedules are not disclosed until after contract execution.

**Risk Rating**\
⚠️ Moderate — The process is standard, but delays are common if documentation (e.g., group NPI, malpractice) is incomplete.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Maintenance & Oversight**\
Site visits may be required for providers offering home-based care. Recredentialing occurs every 3 years and providers must complete annual updates via Availity. Denials often result from outdated malpractice insurance, incomplete credentialing forms, or failure to maintain portal updates.
{% endhint %}

## Payor Report: Priority Health

{% hint style="success" %}
### **Ready to Pursue**

* **Delegated Credentialing**\
  No delegated credentialing arrangements apply.
* **Telehealth Coverage**\
  OT services are supported. Confirm network participation before submitting telehealth claims.
* **Retroactive Billing Policy**\

* **Action Required**\
  Initiate the TIN reassociation request through the Priority Health portal using the provider’s current credentials.
{% endhint %}

**Risk Rating**\
⚠️ Low — Straightforward reassociation if accurate information is submitted.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Maintenance & Oversight**\

{% endhint %}

## Payor Report: Aetna

{% hint style="success" %}
### Ready to Pursue

* **Enrollment Pathway**\
  Individual enrollment is permitted for solo providers. A group contract is available for two or more providers and includes a separate process.

{% endhint %}

**Fee Schedule Visibility**\
📈 High — Fee schedules are accessible via Availity once the provider is registered.

**Risk Rating**\
⚠️ Moderate — A common source of delay is failure to keep CAQH attested or submit all necessary supporting documentation.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Maintenance & Oversight**\
Site visits may be required for home-based providers. Recredentialing occurs every 3 years, and CAQH attestation must be completed quarterly. Denials are typically due to incomplete or outdated documents, work history gaps, or license mismatches.

📈 High — Fee schedules are available for contracted providers within the portal.

**Risk Rating**\
⚠️ Moderate — While the process is accessible, delays are often due to missing attestations or supporting forms.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Maintenance & Oversight**\
Site visits are sometimes required for home health or mobile providers. Recredentialing occurs every 3 years. Denials most often result from incomplete application packages, invalid malpractice coverage, or unverified background information.
{% endhint %}

* **Retroactive Billing Policy**\
  Cannot be determined until enrollment status and MCO credentialing are confirmed.

**Fee Schedule Visibility**\
📊 Medium — CHAMPS provides access to general rates; individual MCOs vary.

**Risk Rating**\
⚠️ High — Current lack of access to CHAMPS and MCO-specific credentialing steps may delay enrollment.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Maintenance & Oversight**\
Home-based providers may be flagged for site verification depending on MCO policy. Revalidation frequency varies (3–5 years). Denials often occur due to lack of access to the CHAMPS portal, outdated contact information, or unlinked NPI-to-group records.
