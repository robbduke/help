### 2. Market Opportunity in Metro Detroit <a href="#id-2.-market-opportunity-in-metro-detroit" id="id-2.-market-opportunity-in-metro-detroit"></a>

#### Key Regional Facts <a href="#key-regional-facts" id="key-regional-facts"></a>

* **Population:** 4.3+ million residents
* **Pediatric Need:** High Medicaid eligibility in Detroit proper; mixed commercial coverage in suburbs
* **Top Employers:** Ford, GM, Henry Ford Health, Trinity Health, Detroit Public Schools
* **Payer Environment:** Dominated by BCBSM/BCN, with significant roles played by Medicaid MCOs, Priority Health, Aetna, and UHC

### 3. Methodology & Payer Mix Rationale <a href="#id-3.-methodology-and-payer-mix-rationale" id="id-3.-methodology-and-payer-mix-rationale"></a>

The projected payer mix was built using local data, payor market share reports, and firsthand insights from the provider and regional trends:

<table><thead><tr><th width="195">Payer</th><th width="90">Allocation</th><th>Rationale</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>BCBSM/BCN</strong></td><td>30%</td><td>Michigan's largest commercial insurer; “super popular” locally</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Medicaid MCOs</strong></td><td>30%</td><td>Essential for low-income families; key for pediatric referrals</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Priority Health</strong></td><td>20%</td><td>Strong regional share in Southeast MI</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aetna</strong></td><td>15%</td><td>Commercial and Medicaid MCO presence</td></tr><tr><td><strong>UnitedHealthcare</strong></td><td>5%</td><td>Smaller but steady role in OT reimbursement</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
Pediatric OTs typically see higher Medicaid representation due to family income thresholds and early intervention funding sources.
{% endhint %}

### 4. Billing & Reimbursement Assumptions <a href="#id-4.-billing-and-reimbursement-assumptions" id="id-4.-billing-and-reimbursement-assumptions"></a>

| CPT Code | Description            | Rate Used                  |
| -------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 97530    | Therapeutic Activities | $57–$80 depending on payer |
