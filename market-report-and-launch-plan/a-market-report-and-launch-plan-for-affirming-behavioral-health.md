# A Market Report & Launch Plan for Affirming Behavioral Health

It reflects research, market analysis, and operational guidance prepared specifically for this practice. No part of this document may be copied, reproduced, distributed, disclosed, or reused for any purpose outside of Affirming Behavioral Health’s internal planning without the prior written consent of pie Health, LLC.

## DISCLAIMER

This document is directional. It’s meant to give you a grounded, realistic view of what credentialing, payer timelines, and early revenue may look like based on what we know today.

Credentialing and payer approvals are dependent on factors outside of anyone’s control, so the actual sequence and timing can differ from these estimates. The goal of this report is to guide your planning, not to promise outcomes. As you move through licensure and into credentialing, we’ll work with the real-time information you receive from the payors.
{% endhint %}

## 1. **Executive Overview**

Affirming Behavioral Health is establishing a new outpatient counseling practice in the Bangor/Hampden region, serving rural and underserved communities across central, northern, and eastern Maine. The practice will employ five full-time clinicians, primarily LCSWs and LCPCs, delivering individual psychotherapy through both in-person and telehealth modalities. The practice expects strong initial demand due to significant behavioral health shortages across Maine.

This launch plan outlines a conservative, data-supported approach to payer enrollment, revenue expectations, and caseload development beginning after the DHHS Mental Health Agency License is issued. All credentialing projections begin at Month 1, representing the first month the practice is legally eligible to enroll with payers.

pie Health supports this plan as a revenue-aware credentialing partner, offering credentialing readiness, payer application management, and progress monitoring. All revenue estimates provided in this plan are illustrative and intended for operational planning, not financial advising.

### **Estimated Credentialing Investment for Affirming Behavioral Health**

_(Based on 10 payors × 5 clinicians; illustrative)_

#### **One-Time Credentialing Fees**

| Line Item                             | Calculation                    | Total       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Payor Research                        | 10 payors × $75                | **$750**    |
| Group Onboarding                      | 1 × $150                       | **$150**    |
| Provider Onboarding                   | 5 providers × $50              | **$250**    |
| Primary Source Verification (PSV)     | 5 providers × $75              | **$375**    |
| Group Contract Applications           | 10 payors × $500               | **$5,000**  |
| Individual Enrollments/Linkages       | 5 providers × 10 payors × $175 | **$8,750**  |
| **Total One-Time Credentialing Fees** | —                              | **$15,275** |

#### **Ongoing Annual Maintenance**

| Line Item              | Calculation           | Total Annual |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| Monthly Maintenance    | 5 providers × $100/mo | $500/mo      |
| **Annual Maintenance** | $500 × 12             | **$6,000**   |

***

#### **Total Estimated Credentialing Investment (Year 1)**

**$15,275 (one-time) + $6,000 (annual maintenance) = $21,275 total estimated Year 1 investment**

\*Does not include payer-required fees (e.g., MaineCare enrollment fee).

#### **Credentialing Investment Compared to Estimated Revenue**

Projected Annual Revenue at Full Capacity: **≈ $506,136**\
Total Year 1 Credentialing Investment: **≈ $21,275**

#### **Credentialing as a Percentage of Revenue: \~4.2%**

This positions credentialing as a **small, foundational operational expense** supporting the practice’s participation across MaineCare, Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans, and commercial insurers.

***

### **Credentialing Workflow Overview**

1. **Immediately after DHHS License Approval**
   * Payor research
   * Group onboarding
   * Provider onboarding
   * PSV initiation
   * MaineCare, Medicare, Anthem, and MA applications submitted
2. **Weeks 2–4**
   * Harvard Pilgrim, CHO, Aetna Commercial, and UHC applications submitted
   * CAQH verification and attestation for each provider
   * Application fee payments processed by practice (if applicable)\*
3. **Ongoing**
   * Twice-monthly application follow-up
   * Linkage/reassignment as payors approve clinicians
   * Maintenance begins after all payors are active

***

#### **Notes**

\*Some payors (e.g., MaineCare) require application fees. These are not included in pie’s credentialing fees and are not reflected in revenue projections.

## **10. Risk Management & Recommendations**

### **Key Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

<table><thead><tr><th width="261.3125">Risk</th><th width="197.4453125">Impact</th><th>Mitigation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Credentialing delays</td><td>Delayed revenue</td><td>Submit early; complete CAQH; bi-weekly follow-up</td></tr><tr><td>CAQH issues</td><td>Application stalls</td><td>Complete all CAQH entries pre-submission</td></tr><tr><td>Network adequacy denials</td><td>CHO/Martin’s Point</td><td>Emphasize rural reach + specialties</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-revenue gap</td><td>Cash flow strain</td><td>Use retroactive billing; limited self-pay during ramp</td></tr><tr><td>Hiring and onboarding delays</td><td>Reduced capacity</td><td>Hire as soon as license obtained</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

## **11. Summary Recommendations**

* Begin all credentialing **immediately upon DHHS license approval**.
* Prioritize **MaineCare → Medicare → Anthem** for earliest revenue.
* Submit early CAQH attestations for all clinicians.
* Plan for **3–5 months of zero-revenue operations** before payer activations.
* Leverage MaineCare and Medicare **retroactive billing** to recapture early visits.
* Expect steady growth with full capacity reached around **Month 7**.
* Maintain strong telehealth infrastructure for rural counties.
* Hold **monthly credentialing status reviews** with pie Health.

## **Appendix**

### **Methodology Summary**

The payer allocation used in this launch plan was developed using four inputs:

1. **Statewide Insurance Participation**\
   Maine has a high proportion of residents covered by MaineCare and Medicare, especially in the counties surrounding Bangor and Hampden. These statewide participation rates establish the baseline for expected payer volume.
2. **Regional Utilization Patterns**\
   The Hampden/Bangor region includes a mix of older adults, rural communities, and long-standing mental health professional shortages. These factors increase demand for MaineCare and Medicare services relative to commercial insurance.
3. **Practice Model & Access Goals**\
   Affirming Behavioral Health intends to serve underserved residents, families, and rural patients. Because these groups are disproportionately insured by MaineCare and Medicare, the allocation reflects that emphasis.
4. **Administrative Requirements**\
   Each commercial and Medicare Advantage plan requires its own application, so those payors are listed individually. Their allocation percentages are adjusted based on market share and expected referral volume.

This methodology blends Maine’s insurance landscape with Affirming Behavioral Health’s service philosophy to create a realistic, demand-aligned payer mix for planning and credentialing.
