# Statement of Work

This Statement of Work ("SOW") is issued pursuant to the Master Services Agreement ("Agreement") between pie Health, LLC (“pie Health”) and&#x20;

\[Customer Name] (“Customer”), and is incorporated therein by reference. This SOW is effective as of the same date as the Agreement.

### PURPOSE

This SOW outlines the Initial Credentialing Services and ongoing maintenance services pie Health will provide to support Customer’s ability to bill independently under their own tax ID.

### SERVICES IN SCOPE

### Pre-Engagement Services (Optional)

These optional services help prospective clients understand their credentialing readiness and develop a launch strategy. They are typically waived but may be billed if provided independently.

* Initial Credentialing Consultation A 30-minute video or phone meeting to review your practice setup, goals, and payor targets. Value: $50 — usually waived
* Market and Launch Plan Includes a recommended payor mix based on geography, specialty, and target demographics; estimated credentialing timeline; and practice launch recommendations. Value: $300 — usually waived

### Phase 1: Initial Credentialing Services

* Payor Participation Discovery: pie Health will prepare a written report identifying payor panel status, enrollment requirements, and likelihood of acceptance based on practice type and location. Includes one 30-minute meeting to review the findings and answer questions. Fee: $75 per payor
* Group Onboarding: pie Health will set up the Customer’s practice as an organization in the pie credentialing system. A pie team member will provide a 30-minute onboarding walkthrough to explain the portal, data entry, and required documentation. Fee: $150 per practice entity/Tax ID (one-time, based on Tax ID)
* Individual Provider Onboarding: Set up provider credentialing profile, request and store documents. Fee: $50 per provider/Type 1 NPI (one-time)
* Primary Source Verification (PSV) PSV is performed per provider to verify credentials such as license, education, board certification, and malpractice history in accordance with payor and industry requirements. Fee: $75 per provider for most license types (e.g., LCSW, LPC) Fee: $150 per provider for physicians and advanced practice providers (e.g., MD, DO, NP)
* Individual Provider Enrollment Applications: Credentialing submission for Customer as a rendering provider to selected payors. Fee: $175 per payor
* Follow-Up Services: Each credentialing enrollment includes up to 3 months (90 days) of follow-up, beginning from the date of submission. During this period, pie Health will:
  * Perform two scheduled outreach attempts per month to each payor to check the status of submitted applications (for a total of six follow-up attempts per payor)
  * Provide application tracking updates in the pie portal
  * Address any required clarifications or supplemental requests from payors
* If a submitted enrollment requires resubmission due to a payor delay or client error, one resubmission is included per payor. Any additional resubmissions for the same payor will be billed at $140 per occurrence, unless the issue was caused by a pie Health error.\
  The start of the maintenance period is triggered by whichever occurs first:
  * The first credentialing approval from any payor for any provider listed in this SOW
  * Ninety (90) calendar days from the execution date of this SOW
* This trigger applies regardless of the status of other pending enrollments. Once the maintenance period begins, pie Health will begin billing the Customer at $100 per provider per month, as detailed in the following section.

### Phase 2: Monthly Maintenance Services&#x20;

Once the maintenance period begins, Customer will enter a 12-month maintenance plan that includes:

* Maintenance Services
  * CAQH attestations and monitoring
  * Payor directory attestations (directory profile maintenance and status confirmation with known payors)
  * Tracking expirables
  * Credentialing status and document updates in the pie portal
  * Ongoing PSV updates during recredentialing cycles
  * One 30-minute webinar-style call per month (optional)
  * Follow-ups with payors and portal updates twice monthly or as needed

Fee: $100/month per Type 1 NPI for 12 months

During the maintenance period:

* Additional individual enrollments may be requested at $175 per payor.
* If group contracts are later requested, they will be billed at $500 per payor.
* Maintenance clients are eligible for one resubmission per payor at no additional cost, regardless of whether the need for resubmission is due to a payor delay or client error. Any subsequent resubmissions for the same payor will be billed at $140 per occurrence.

### PASS-THROUGH EXPENSES AND SERVICE HANDLING FEES

Certain credentialing tasks may require third-party documentation or services not included in the above pricing. These may include:

* NPDB queries
* AMA or AOA physician profiles
* Education or training verification requiring payment
* FCVS reports
* State board lookup fees
* Background checks
* Translation, notarization, or identity verification
* Physical mailing or courier submissions

These costs will be treated as pass-through expenses and billed at cost, with notice provided when reasonably possible.

For any such instance requiring pie Health to coordinate, prepare, or facilitate the transaction, a Service Handling Fee of $25 per instance will apply. This fee covers administrative labor related to form submission, payment processing, mailing logistics, or documentation preparation.

### PRINTED MATERIALS & MAILING COSTS

Some payors may require submission of physical materials, including original signatures, notarized documents, or mailed applications. If pie Health prepares, prints, and mails these documents on behalf of the Customer:

* Postage, courier, and printing costs (e.g., USPS, FedEx, printing supplies) will be billed as pass-through expenses, with no markup
* A Service Handling Fee of $25 per mailing will be applied to cover the administrative time spent preparing and processing the shipment

Rush or certified mail will only be used when required by a payor or specifically approved by the Customer. pie Health does not apply markup to third-party shipping or material costs. Handling fees cover the administrative time required to prepare and process mailings.

### CLIENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Submit all required documentation through the onboarding portal
* Respond to pie Health requests within five (5) business days
* Avoid direct payor contact while credentialing is in progress
* Inform pie Health of any changes or delays that could impact the project

### CLIENT INACTIVITY AND PROJECT DORMANCY

Customer is expected to initiate and complete onboarding within forty-five (45) days of invoice payment. pie Health will make reasonable efforts to assist and accommodate the Customer during this period, including reminders, guidance, and system access. Failure to do so may result in the application of dormancy protocols outlined below.

If onboarding cannot be completed within that window due to documented delays outside of the Customer’s control—such as missing payor data, NPPES/IRS processing delays, or other third-party issues—Customer must notify pie Health in writing. pie Health may, at its discretion, grant up to an additional thirty (30) days to resolve such delays.

If onboarding is not completed within seventy-five (75) days of payment, or if Customer becomes unresponsive for more than thirty (30) consecutive days at any point during the project, pie Health will review the situation with the Customer before taking further action. If the Customer does not re-engage within a reasonable timeframe following that outreach, pie Health reserves the right to proceed unilaterally and may:

* pause all work,
* restrict portal access,
* place the project in dormant status, and
* issue a notice of potential abandonment.

If the total period of inactivity reaches ninety (90) days from payment without resolution or engagement, the project will be considered abandoned. pie Health may: (a) close the project file, (b) retain all fees paid as non-refundable, and (c) require a new agreement and payment to restart services.

Reinstatement of services is not guaranteed and will be subject to current pricing, system availability, and onboarding capacity.

### TERM AND TERMINATION

This SOW remains in effect until all Initial Credentialing Services have received a determination (approval, denial, or resubmission request), and the 12-month maintenance term has been completed. If terminated early by Customer, maintenance fees remain payable per the Agreement. Termination of this SOW does not relieve Customer of financial obligations already incurred or committed under its terms.

### DISCLAIMERS

pie Health makes no guarantee of credentialing approval by any payor. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring they do not deliver services requiring credentialing until approval is confirmed. pie Health is not liable for delays, rejections, or network access restrictions due to payor backlog, undisclosed prior contracting, or eligibility limitations.
